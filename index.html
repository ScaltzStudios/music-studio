<h3>Bio</h3>
<wtbox><p>
	Mr. Scaltz has always been a guitarist and teacher; his experience and interest in cultivating minds began in his teenage years when he had the fortune of becoming an assistant teacher at a local music studio in his hometown of Pittston, Pa. As a player since the age of eight and an instructor at thirteen, he quickly realized that the most influential individuals in his life were his own mentors and teachers, and desperately needed to reciprocate the gift of knowledge to others through intense study and practice. Over the next fifteen years, Mr. Scaltz had dedicated his lifeâ€™s work to teaching others the technical aspects of the instrument, and while he always knew that being a professional guitarist would become his life's pursuit, he began to practice one of the very first tenets given to him as a youth: you can't give to others what you don't already possess for yourself.</br>

	    </br>He has owned and operated four music studios in three states and achieved high acclaim for his teaching during his tenure as head of Scaltz Guitar Studio in State College, Pa. As a guitarist and music theorist his approaches to the art have been in high demand for years, and his students have had successful careers post-high school, namely at music conservatories as Berklee College of Music, Eastman School, and Full Sail Recording School.</br>

	    </br>In 2005, he began a professional career as a high-school teacher, where he has won numerous awards for his ability to connect with students on profound levels based on respect and compassion. Later, his unique approach to the field of guitar performance has made him a sought-after teacher, and he continually serves as a reference to other practitioners through his knowledge and expertise in the field of technical guitar studies.</br>

	   </br>In 2011, Scaltz Guitar Studios reopened with a base in Central Maryland which he now considers the most developed and matured of all of his previous schools.</br>

	  </br>Mr. Scaltz holds a Master's Degree in Education from The Pennsylvania State University and teaching licenses in three states: Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Ohio.</br>

	   </br>Mr. Scaltz currently lives in Central Maryland with his wife Tracy, daughter Gianna L'Wren, and their three dogs: Trebol, Hobbes, and Boomer. </br>
